# Lab: Sign up Form

This lab uses what students have learned so far to create a sign up form using `reactstrap`

**Teaching Tip**:


Assign it to individuals who are caught up with their work and looking for a further challenge. Or, do it with the whole class if time permits and you feel that students would benefit from it.

## Requirements

Build a sign up form using `create-react-app` and `reactstrap` to collect the name, email, picture, and hidden password for a user. `console.log` what the user's inputs when they submit the form.
